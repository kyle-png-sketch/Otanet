      <h1>Story</h1>
            
      <P>Otanet was create from a simple idea to give otakus a place they can truly call home.
      As passionate fans of anime,games and tech ourselves, we noticed that mainstream platform
      didn't fully capture the energy and creativity of otaku culture. So, we set out to build a digital world
      where fandom thrives, where artist,gamers,cosplayers, and dreamers can connect,share, and grow together.Otanet
      isn't just platform it's a community made by and for otakus.</P>

      <h1>Inspired</h1>
                
      <P>I like anime because it makes reality more colorful and dreams possible.
      Every story teaches me something new, every character reminds me to keep going.
